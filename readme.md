# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my journey as a Full Stack Developer, my featured projects, and certifications.  
It was originally built using **HTML & CSS** (during my early learning days) and later updated with a **Dark Mode toggle (JavaScript)**.  
The portfolio is fully responsive and deployed on **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)**.
